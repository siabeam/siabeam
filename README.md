I'm a data analyst with a strong interest in machine learning, algorithms, programming etc.
I enjoy working with data, exploring patterns, and applying statistical thinking to solve problems.  
I'm currently expanding my skills in ML, statistics and software development by building hands-on projects and sharing them here on GitHub.

I simply come up with ideas of what I need or want to create and learn everything I need to build it. For example: I need to remember all the foreign words from the book I read, so my next project is a flash-card game for me to memorize all the words. Besides I want it to save stats of my attempts and progress for me to understand what I need to work on. (Repos: `html-css-course`, `flash-cards-vocabulary`)

## Tech Stack
- Python, pandas, matplotlib/seaborn, scikit-learn  
- SQL, PySpark, Git, Bash  
- Some HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Jupyter, PyCharm

## Interests
- Building my own models and tools from scratch (they can vary)  
- Hands-on learning through side projects  
- Statistical modeling and explainable ML  
- Algorithms, dashboards
