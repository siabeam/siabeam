I'm a data analyst with a strong interest in machine learning, algorithms, programming etc.
I enjoy working with data, exploring patterns, and applying statistical thinking to solve problems.  
I'm currently expanding my skills in ML, statistics and software development by building hands-on projects and sharing them here on GitHub.

## Tech Stack
- Python, pandas, matplotlib/seaborn, scikit-learn  
- SQL, PySpark, Git, Bash  
- Some HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Jupyter, PyCharm

## Interests
- Building my own models and tools from scratch (they can vary)  
- Hands-on learning through side projects  
- Statistical modeling and ML  
- Algorithms, dashboards
- Web and software development
